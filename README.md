# AngularJS-AWS-HTTPS-SSO
Sanitized source code from a project that used Single Sign On (SSO) for an AngularJS website and was hosted on Amazon Web Service (AWS). The website content has been removed because it's not needed for a discussion of using SSO with AWS.

Codebase taken from https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1248145/How-to-use-SAML-in-an-Angular-JS-Single-Page-Appli

Hopefully this example will grow into a full SAML/Samlify tutorial for those who are searching how to implement SSO, while keeping their sanity
